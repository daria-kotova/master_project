First test: create a character based on objects on the photos

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test1-7.jpg" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- Creating characters turned out to be easier and faster, because we all have an idea of what a character is. But once you know what you're doing, it becomes repetitive leading to a new constraint of trying to do something that you haven't already done.

- For some it was difficult to go further than just a face or a stick man. Lack of variation in the results.

- One participant said that it was obvious when she saw the pine tree photo and drew a peacock, while for me a hedgehog was more obvious. Different perspectives on the same thing.

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test1-5.jpg" width="500" />

- Drawback: you can't choose the object (proved on 09.01.2025 that a "forced" object sparks more creativity) and position it as you want. Freedom in positioning is necessary.

- Lacked social aspect and unexpected contribution to the story from others like in previous tests.

- Photos were viewed more as a 2D space, the 3D aspect was often lost.

Conclusion:

- Overall, the objects on photos helped with ideas, but didn't lead to super creative results. Limitation of the task "create a character"?

- Character creation and world-building are two different tasks. The former one is more suitable for one person, while the latter is more fun in collaboration.

- The objects were curated by me. Not everyone pays attention to their surroundings?

Second test: make the space on the photo yours, make it more beautiful, add what's missing or whatever you want. Reference: Concrete genie

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test2-4.jpg" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- The task wasn't always clear and people interpreted it differently. One participant took it literally and was turning public spaces into her personal ones, ignoring the space itself (the ugly graffiti)

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test2-5.jpg" width="500" />

- Participant who was struggling with the previous test and claimed he couldn't draw seemed much more invested this time and gave more creative results, since the task was more open in a way.

- Photo with graffiti - painting on wall, not really new

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test2-6.jpg" width="500" />

- Sometimes people didn't want to add any elements to familiar places.

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-10/test2-7.jpg" width="500" />

Conclusion:

I wanted to see how the space itself can inspire people, but results showed that it isn't always sufficient to spark ideas.

## 09-01-2025

From the test day, it was clear that people enjoyed the experiment and had a lot of fun creating worlds using abstract objects and drawing. To see clearer what aspects of the experiment impacted more the satisfaction from it, I tried a number of quick variations of the original test.

First, I asked one of the original participants to do the same task but all alone (no photo).

Feedback/observations:

- The experience was less smooth and sometimes she was struggling with where to lead her story further, while in the collective test you can let the other person decide for you the next part

- Since it was just her, she wanted to keep the consistency and used similar objects

- At some time she switched her initial idea: a mountain later became a building

- She was reusing ideas that they had had during the second session of the test day. Need variation of objects. How to make sure that people do not get bored of the same objects?

- Overall impression: less fun and too much to think about. It was in a way easy, but she had to deal with too many ideas, while with others the control of the story-telling is shared.

———

In the second test, the objects were chosen for you.

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-09/IMG_3207.JPG" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- "When the level of freedom is too high, you don’t have freedom anymore". Being forced to use an object actually simplified things and pushed one's imagination.

- Somehow it makes you focus more on the story.

———

Those two quick tests showed that collaboration was essential in making the experiment fun and contributed to a ricjer story-telling, while the freedom of choice of the objects didn't matter that much and rather complicated things.

———

It made sense to try out a similar test (world creation in a group), but with more concrete objects.

<img src="/research/photos/2025-01-09/IMG_3210.JPG" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- Using real objects adds to the fun. If you look without knowing the story, it’s random objects, and only the creators really know the story. May be suitable for a drinking game?

- Some people may be trapped by the real object. You really need to ignore their original purpose and focus on the shape which is not always easy.

- Abstract objects open imagination. They immerse more in the world. The story is easier to build. More serious and artsy.

## 18-12-2024 (Test day)

In the first session, I took part in the experiment with others. We started by choosing a place and a time and ended up with a beach scene, nothing crazy. Participants suggested trying to start from zero and not intervening to see what it gives.

<img src="/research/photos/2024-12-18-test-day/session1-02.jpg" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- As time went on, we started switching to larger objects (started with small and ended with something big). Some people rely more on the objects and add little drawings, while others become more creative.

- It seems that I unconsciously created "families" of shapes, which was approuved.

- 3d aspect is good and playful (the 3D objects, as well as different surfaces). Would be curious to see it at a bigger scale, maybe in a room.

- Sound as a prompt?

- What people already do: everyone gets the same prompt, you draw a part, then switch with others and continue someone’s drawing -> shows different interpretations of the same thing

———

In the second session things got weird. We started from zero and I was just observing. This is the story participants created: flying jacket on the cloud, that can have some rest by hanging on the cliff. The war of three armies. Underworld, with a castle and evil eye. Someone died playing a giant tic tac toe. A gate to enter tic-tac-toe. It’s all imagination of a girl dying her hair.

<img src="/research/photos/2024-12-18-test-day/session2-02.jpg" width="500" />

Feedback/observations:

- Randomness in objects is good. 3D ones are better, they can be interprated differently, from different perspective (angle, viewpoint). Bigger 3D objects work better in terms of story telling, they force you to create a story with them, more imposing. Small ones are more like accessories. Hollow once are more interesting, can draw inside.

- Less fun with predetermined setting.

- Having to describe what you’re doing is good because you have background from the others and have to consider them.

- It's easier to start with a place, but maybe these ideas constrain the way you use the props.

- Different surface levels have different scales.

- Went out of the canvas. But yesterday we didn’t use all of the canvas

- Always wanted to put stuff in the centre.

- Move objects to other places? Smth modular. Rewrite a story?

——

Results

- People found the experiment really fun and entertaining.

- Starting from zero with no predetermined setting really frees up imagination, even though at the beginning it may be complicated to start. It seems that this fact led to a more absurd and fun outcome.

- 3D objects and the possibility of creating in space is more interesting. 3D objects can be interpreted from different angles (same with flat once? Can turn them). From the 3D objects, ones that had halls presented additional opportunities for creation. Bigger objects were driving more the storytelling aspects, while smaller once added details.

- It was important to describe what you were doing, which was holding the structure of the story and forced you to coordinate with previous people.

- The scale varied throughout the levels and really impacted the perception of the world.

- Overall the activity was fun and the use of visual/physical abstract prompts did help with the blank page syndrome and fueled the creativity.

- Should consider using sounds as prompts. Maybe something similarly abstract, that just has a certain rigor or emotion.

- Consider scale of the experience. Some people want to get out of the canvas, while others stay within it.

- Can you move the objects and rewrite the story?

## 17-12-2024

Did some tests with classmates. The first one was with Andrés. This time I left the canvas clear. We were creating the world together by drawing and adding objects in turns, starting from Andrés choosing a place and time. At some point I introduced a rule: every turn you needed to pick an object and draw something around it to integrate it into the space. The space had several dimensions, not just common horizontal surface.

In the end, we didn't really build a world, but rather created a story. The Story: New York, 2020, summer. It's a very hot day, there's steam rising from the ground. We can see the Central park, skyscrappers. Andrés is on his way to drop his kid at the kindergarten, but he's stuck at the highway, there're traffic jams and a car accident. Ambulances are trying to get to the injured man, but can't. Andrés gets his coffee and then goes to the accident scene to film it live. But he's not the only one recording, in the sky behind a cloud a helicopter with a cameraman appears. There's also a park with a Guggenheim exhibition. Under the ground, the subway lives its life and a bit above - a system of pipes. In one of them a rat is running attracted by the smell of trash. The trash stinks so terribly that flies are circulating around it on the surface thinking that it's a pile of poop.

The second test was with Jasmine. This time, I changed pieces of paper to rolls of paper, since it's easier to set up. I definitely need more objects, but the concept works well, everyone is entertained and it's interesting to see how people interprate the objects.

Story behind: we're in Germany, in the mountains. There's a castle on top of the mountain like in Cinderella. On another mountain, goats are running and enjoying their lives. There's a lake with a waterfall and rocks at the bottom. A playground. Suddenly, in the sky a dragon appears. But don't worry, a diabolic angel with thousand eyes is going to fight it. Supporters on the stadium are observing the scene.

Spent the rest of the day making more objects and setting up for the test day.

## 16-12-2024

Created various paper/cardboard abstract objects and placed them in the space. Just placing them like that did not give any ideas, need some prompts.

Brief

_What I want to explore_

How people can interact with their surroundings through drawing

_How I am going to do it_

- Solutions to “I do not know what to draw” problem (prompts, - cues?)
- Ways to draw in the space (movements, voice, digital brushes)
- Motivations
- Community aspect (collaboration, sharing)

_What am I going to create for TEST DAY_

- visual cues (paper prototypes, objects)
- audio cues (instructions, help a character)

_What are the first steps/experiments?_

- see above
- taking photos of ugly spots around the city and “improving them”
- audio cues on a larger scale with GPS-drawings (tried before)

# How it all started

For my master's thesis I chose the topic of GPS-drawings and running. Among the aspects that I liked and decided to carry on with are:

- drawing your body
- interacting with the space, getting a new perspective on it
- using city as your playground
- community: sharing and creating with others
- the idea of leaving an invisble trace

<img src="/research/photos/thesis/all.jpg" width="500" />

Some of the tests

- giving each other a task of what to draw while running and doing it on the spot without consulting the map

<img src="/research/photos/thesis/cloud.jpg" width="500" />

<img src="/research/photos/thesis/star.jpg" width="500" />

- trying to draw together simultaneously

<img src="/research/photos/thesis/hi.jpg" width="500" />

Results:

- The GPS-tracking wasn't precise enough
- It was hard to position yourself in the space and even harder to coordinate with each other
- Curious to see the outcome. Doing it together added to the fun
